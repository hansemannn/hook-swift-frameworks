# Swift iOS Frameworks in Titanium
Support Swift frameworks in native Titanium modules.

### Prerequisites
- [x] Titanium SDK 6.2.0+ (to support dynamic libraries in general)
- [x] Swift framework that exposes an Objective-C public-header

### Usage
1. Download the `ti.swiftsupport.js` file and open it
2. Search for the `SWIFT_VERSION` variable and specify your Swift version used [[*](#note-1)]
3. Adjust your module project code by placing the `ti.swiftsupport.js` file in `<your-module-ios-root>/hooks`
5. That's it!

##### Note 1: 
This is required since Swift currently does not have ABI-stability which is expected to be supported in future versions of Swift. Until then, you always need to use the Swift version that the framework was compiled with.

##### Note 2:
If you use Hyperloop, you can add this hook as a plugin. To do so:

  1. Place the ti.dynamiclib.js file in <your-project-root>/plugins/ti.swiftsupport/hooks (create dirs)
  2. Add the plugin to your tiapp: <plugin>ti.swiftsupport</plugin>
